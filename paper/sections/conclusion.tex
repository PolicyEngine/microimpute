\section{Conclusion}

This paper has reviewed methodological advances in microdata imputation, focusing on techniques suitable for complex survey data like wealth. We highlighted the limitations of traditional methods and the promise of advanced approaches, particularly Quantile Regression Forests, for handling skewed distributions and non-linearities.

The key contributions of this work are the synthesis of current knowledge on imputation for challenging microdata, a detailed examination of QRF's suitability, and an introduction to the Microimpute package. Our review suggests that QRF represents a significant step forward in preserving the statistical integrity of imputed microdata, crucial for robust economic and social analysis. The implementation of QRF in the Microimpute package provides a practical tool for researchers seeking to combine detailed microdata across datasets.

Future research should continue to refine QRF for imputation, particularly in response to challenges like limited data at extreme quantiles. Comparative studies against other emerging techniques, like deep learning models \citep{alaa2024deep}, are also vital. Continued innovation in imputation methodology is fundamental to the integrity of evidence-based research and policymaking.
